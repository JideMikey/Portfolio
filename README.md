## Aim
The aim of this site is to act as a portfolio for the Graphic design that i have done. It should also enable clients to contact me through the website as well as fint where the business is located.

## Paper Design
Before the site was created, it was wireframed using paper. Here are the designs

## The Portfolio
The Portfolio works very well and has been tested for errors. The home page is styled in a very sleek way that brings a professional feel to the site.

The Portfolio page shows four examples of Mikey Medias work. These are split in to four sections and each section changes as it is hovered over. When a section is clicked, it is enlarged and a brief description of the company is given.

The Contact page comes fit with a contact page that allows users to fill in the contact form with their details in order to send an email to Mikey Media's email. The contact form is validated and won't allow for wrong data types or blank fields to be used.

The about page comes with a map that allows the user of the website to find where the business is located. This is done using API.
